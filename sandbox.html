                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Minecraft</strong> is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios where players can interact with a fully customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay options allow players to choose the way they play, creating countless possibilities.</p>
                <p>I decided to do my sandbox project not only because it has always been my favorite video game since the third grade when I started playing, but it also has thousands of details that can be included in an HTML about it.</p>

                <h2>Game Modes</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3>Creative</h3>
                    <p>In creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly. Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger. The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.</p>

                    <h3>Survival</h3>
                    <p>In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items. Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night. The three difficulties are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Peaceful</li>
                        <li>Easy</li>
                        <li>Medium</li>
                        <li>Hard</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Peaceful</strong> is the only difficulty where no hostile mobs will spawn, regardless of the time it is in the game. </p>

                    <h3>Passive</h3>
                    <p>Passive mobs are harmless mobs (except for pufferfish which is defensive) that do not attempt to attack the player, even when provoked or attacked, though some of them may attack other mobs. Most of them can be bred or tamed. The following are all the passive mobs as of the latest update (1.21):</p>

                    <h3>Neutral</h3>
                    <p>Neutral mobs are sometimes passive and sometimes hostile toward the player. These mobs usually require provocation from the player in one way or another to attack or become hostile, while some can be naturally-hostile and have a way to be pacified.</p>

                    <h3>Hostile</h3>
                    <p>Hostile mobs are dangerous, aggressive mobs that always attack the player within their respective detection ranges. Certain non-hostile mobs such as chickens, skeleton horses and spiders can be mounted by hostile mobs on rare occasions, and become hostile.</p>

                    <h3>Bosses</h3>
                    <p>Boss mobs are special <em>hostile mobs</em> that are tougher and more dangerous than other mobs. They do not spawn randomly and are confronted intentionally. All boss mobs have a bossbar featuring their name and health. Boss mobs provide unique challenges and equivalent rewards, such as XP.</p>

                    <p>The two boss mobs are the <strong>Ender Dragon</strong>, and the <strong>Wither</strong>.</p>
